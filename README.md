MySQL_Createrepo
================
This is a simple script to download a list of the RPMs released for the various major versions of MySQL
It will then parse it, and subsequently download the needed RPMs
Afterwards, it will place them into a directory structure conducive to a yum repository tree, and can do the createrepo part.
